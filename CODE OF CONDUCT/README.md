This Code of Conduct also applies equally to all sponsors and partners of hackathons, and to all projects that are made at the hackathon.

## No plagiarism or re-using of past work
We encourage you to submit projects only prepared in the duration of the hackathon.
However, if you decide to submit projects consisting of re-used code, or re-submit a project that you have already submitted previously to any other hackathon, you are to disclose such previous use and its extent with the submission.


If upon inspection, it is found that the project has re-used code that was not disclosed with the submission, the organizer may ask the participant to point out similarities and differences between the old and new work, and/or disqualify the submission from winning awards automatically.

## No recording without consent
While photography and videography is encouraged, other participants must be given a reasonable chance to opt out from being photographed. If they object to the taking of their photograph, comply with their request.


If they express their disapproval after the photo or video has been captured, please delete it from your records, and in case it has been shared online, take reasonable steps to retract it from social media as well.


It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy (in bathrooms or where participants are sleeping).

We will be happy to help participants contact local security or local law enforcement, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the hackathon. We value your attendance.

## Consequences of violations
In case any participant violates this Code of Conduct, the organizer may, at their own discretion:

- expel them from the hackathon with no refund (if applicable),
